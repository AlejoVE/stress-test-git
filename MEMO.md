# Git


Git is version control software designed by Linus Torvalds with efficiency, reliability, and compatibility in mind when maintaining versions of applications with large numbers of source code files. Its purpose is to track changes to computer files including coordinating the work that various people do on shared files in github.

Git also has excellent support for branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has lead to many innovative and powerful workflows and tools. Pull requests are one such popular tool that allow teams to collaborate on Git branches and efficiently review each others code. Git is the most widely used version control system in the world today and is considered the modern standard for software development.
